Internship at Exposys DataLabs

Accurately forecasting a company's future financial success is crucial for business owners, investors, and stakeholders. Machine Learning models offer a promising solution to this challenge by utilizing historical financial data to make precise profit predictions.
 
In this project, our goal is to create an ML model that can predict a company's profit based on three input variables: R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend. The dataset for this project includes historical data from various companies, detailing the mentioned variables and their corresponding profits.
 
To build the model, we employ linear regression, a well-known machine learning algorithm for predicting continuous outcomes. Initially, we conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify any potential issues that might affect the model's performance. We then preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it for model use.
 
Afterward, we divide the data into training and testing sets and train the linear regression model on the training data. The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared value to assess its accuracy.
 
The resulting model can aid business owners and investors in making informed decisions about a company's financial potential. By leveraging machine learning, we provide accurate and reliable predictions that can guide investment decisions and support business growth.
